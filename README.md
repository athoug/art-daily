# Art Daily
The goal is to create one sketch every day for a year. All shapes, patterns, and colors are made by code. 

At the start of this journey, I plan on using the resource [funprogramming.org ](https://funprogramming.org/)

The table below will hold the day, the sketch name, the link to the sketch, link to the article (if it exists)
