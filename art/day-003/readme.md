# Day 3 - Shades of Color and FrameRates
Last we stopped was when we discussed the `draw` method and having our line be drawn in different locations
based on the `random` method to make it look like it's moving we added the `background` method which acts
as if we have a blank piece of paper and started drawing again. In today's lesson we'll continue exploring 
the `background` method


## Background
so when we look at the docs of the [background](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background) we see that there are different ways
to use it. we can use it with a single argument 
```
  background(51)
```
we can use it with 3 arguments
```
  background(255, 204, 0);
```
and a couple of other ways as well but what are those arguments? well, they are to specify the color. To learn more about it
we can check out the [`color`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color) method that goes a bit deeper with the different versions

but what we need to know is that there are 2 types of colors 
**additive:**
you start with black and the more light you add the brighter it gets
the most basic example is RGB which stands for red green blue. 
0 - 255 there are 256 possible values

**subtractive**
you start with white and the more ink you add the darker it gets
it's what printers use and the most basic example is CMYK 
which stands for cyan magenta yellow black 

[colorMode](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/colorMode) in the docs might explain it better

![color modes](https://cdn1.slideserve.com/2139710/additive-and-subtractive-color-n.jpg)

so let's try to use that in our code by getting a random color 

```
  background(random(256), random(256), random(256));
```

## FrameRate and Setup
Now let's try to get the colors to be animated. From the last lesson, we learned that the method that does the looping is 
`draw` so let's add that and see what we get 
```
  function draw() {
    background(random(256), random(256), random(256));
  }
```
So the program works fine however, it's too fast. Let's see if there is a way we can slow the drawing down. and when we check 
the docs, we can see that there is a method called [`frameRate`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/frameRate) that controls 
how many frames are drawn per second. However, it says something about a setup. 
And when we check the description of [`setup`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup) in the docs we realize that it's a method
that runs once at the start of the program so all the setup and adjustments that we want to run once are added there.
Now the updated program looks like this
```
  // setup() is called once at the start of the program
function setup() {
  // framerate() tells processing how many times per second
  // it should execute draw()
  frameRate(1);
}

function draw() {
    background(random(256), random(256), random(256));
  }
```

And that was the end of the lesson. Now it's just time for me to put that into practice. Also, I noticed my practice makes
me jump into lessons. I already did the `random`, `setup`, and `frameRates` since day 1 ðŸ˜… oh well...

## Practice
so the practice is the same as the described example above. My energy is a bit low so I think this will do for today.

And with that day 3 is done âœ…
